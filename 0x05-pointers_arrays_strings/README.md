# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
For this project, we shall look at these concepts:

## Pointers and arrays
## Data Structures
### function that swaps the values of two integers.
#### 1-swap.c
### function that returns the length of a string.
#### 2-strlen.c
### function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
#### 3-puts.c
### function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
#### 4-print_rev.c
### function that reverses a string.
#### 5-rev_string.c
### function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
#### 6-puts2.c
### function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
#### 7-puts_half.c
### function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
#### 8-print_array.c
### function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
#### 9-strcpy.c
### function that convert a string to an integer.
#### 100-atoi.c
### program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
#### 101-keygen.c
